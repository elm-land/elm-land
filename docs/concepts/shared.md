# Shared

## Overview

The `Shared` module is designed to enable us to __share data between pages__. To understand why it exists, it might first be helpful to understand how Elm Land stores information. Under the hood, Elm Land generates a bit of code for making a standard Elm application.

Normally, Elm applications have a single, top-level `Model` that represents the entire state of our application. Elm Land is no different, except it generates that `Model` for us. This allows you to focus on creating smaller models for each page.

Here's a high-level overview of the `Model` that is used internally by Elm Land to store our web application state:

```elm
type alias Model =
    { shared : Shared.Model
    , page : Pages.Model
    }
```

Every Elm Land application has two fields:
- `shared` - stores data that is available to every page
- `page` field - stores data for the current page

### A quick example

For example, if we had an application with a `Dashboard`, `Settings`, and `SignIn` page, this would be the generated `Pages.Model` type:

```elm
module Pages exposing (..)

-- ...

type Model
    = Dashboard Pages.Dashboard.Model
    | Settings Pages.Settings.Model
    | SignIn Pages.SignIn.Model
```

When a user visits a URL like `/dashboard`, Elm Land calls the `Pages.Dashboard.init` function to determine the initial state of `Pages.Dashboard.Model`. Each time the user navigates to a different page, the `model.page` field is cleared out, and replaced with the `Model` for the new page.

```elm
-- 1️⃣ User visits `/dashboard` (`Pages.Dashboard.init` is called)
model.page ==
    { shared = {}
    , page = Dashboard { ... }
    }

-- 2️⃣ User clicks a link to `/settings` (`Pages.Settings.init` is called)
model.page ==
    { shared = {}
    , page = Settings { ... }
    }

-- 3️⃣ User refreshes the page (`Pages.Settings.init` is called again)
model.page ==
    { shared = {}
    , page = Settings { ... }
    }
```

The important thing to understand is that as the user changes the URL, the entire `model.page` field is replaced with a new one. This behavior helps make Elm Land pages easier to understand, but introduces a new challenge: "How do we share information like a signed-in user across pages?"

## Customizing the `Shared` modules

In order to create data that should be available across pages, we'll want to customize our `Shared.Model` so it can store whatever information is important for our specific app.

Elm Land has a `customize` command for allowing you to gradually adopt more features in your Elm application. Let's use this command to get started:

```sh
elm-land customize shared
```

To prevent an issue with a circular import dependency with `Effect`, the `Shared` modules need to be broken into three separate files. Here's what each file is for:

File | Description
:-- | :--
`src/Shared/Model.elm` | Defines the `Shared.Model` we want to share across every page
`src/Shared/Msg.elm` | Defines the ways our `Shared.Model` can be updated
`src/Shared.elm` | Defines the `init`, `update`, and `subscriptions` functions

## `Shared.Model`

The `Model` type in `src/Shared/Model.elm` defines what data is available on every page. 

For example, you might add two fields to track:

```elm{4-15}
module Shared.Model exposing (..)

type alias Model =
    { user : Maybe User
    , window :
        { width : Int
        , height : Int
        }
    }

type alias User =
    { username : String
    , avatarUrl : Maybe String
    }
```

## `Shared.init`

The `init` function in the `src/Shared.elm` file defines the initial state of our `Shared.Model`. This function is called anytime the web application __loads for the first time__ or is __refreshed__.


For example, if you have edited the `Shared.Model`, you'll see a compiler error message saying that this function needs to be updated. 

```elm{7-9}
module Shared exposing (..)

-- ...

init : Result Json.Decode.Error Flags -> Route () -> ( Model, Effect Msg )
init flagsResult route =
    ( { user = Nothing
      , window = { width = 0, height = 0 }
      }
    , Effect.none
    )

-- ...
```

It takes in two arguments as input:
1. `flagsResult` - The result of decoding the [Shared.Flags](#shared-flags) type (covered next)
1. `route` - Information about the current URL, including query parameters, path, etc

And returns the initial value of `Shared.Model` and any effects that need to run. For a real user authentication example, check out the [User Auth](../guide/user-auth.md) guide.

## `Shared.Flags`

The `Shared.Flags` type represents the initial data (if any) you expect to be passed in from JavaScript on startup. If you add a new `src/interop.js` file, you can define a `flags` function that returns the initial data.

### Defining flags

For example, you might want to pass in the initial `window` dimensions when your application loads. This would involve editing these two files:

__`src/interop.js`__

```js{1-6}
export const flags = ({ env }) => {
  return {
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight,
  }
}
```

__`src/Shared.elm`__

```elm{6-8,13-15}
module Shared exposing (..)

-- ...

type alias Flags = 
    { width : Int
    , height : Int
    }


decoder : Json.Decode.Decoder Flags
decoder =
    Json.Decode.map2 Flags
        (Json.Decode.field "width" Json.Decode.int)
        (Json.Decode.field "height" Json.Decode.int)

-- ...
```

### Using flags

After these changes, your `init` function will receive the safely decoded JSON data in the first argument, `flagsResult`:

__`src/Shared.elm`__

```elm{7-18,21-23}
module Shared exposing (..)

-- ...

init : Result Json.Decode.Error Flags -> Route () -> ( Model, Effect Msg )
init flagsResult route =
    let
        flags : Flags
        flags =
            case flagsResult of
                Ok value ->
                    value

                Err reason ->
                    { width = 0
                    , height = 0 
                    }
    in
    ( { user = Nothing
      , window =
          { width = flags.width
          , height = flags.height
          }
      }
    , Effect.none
    )

-- ...
```

In our example above, everything would work out great. Later on, if our JavaScript file had a typo or returned other JSON we don't expect, our Elm application would gracefully fallback to the default `{ width = 0, height = 0 }` value from before. This means our Elm application will never crash from unexpected JSON data!

::: tip "What about error handling?"

If you have an error reporting service, we recommend logging the `Json.Decode.Error` value so you know about any issues coming from the JavaScript flags

:::

## `Shared.Msg`

The `Msg` type defined in `Shared.Msg` makes it available for use in the `Shared` module, as well as [the `Effect` module](./effect.md) covered later in the guide.

This type works just like page or layout's `Msg` value: it defines all the possible events that can be handled by the `Shared.update` function.

For example, you might define `Msg` values like these:

```elm{3,6-8}
module Shared.Msg exposing (..)

import Shared.Model exposing (User)

type Msg
    = SignInApiResponded User
    | SignOutClicked
    | WindowResized Int Int
```

In the next section, we'll see how `Shared.update` uses these values to make changes to the `Shared.Model`!

## `Shared.update`

The `update` function handles how our `Shared.Model` should change in response to events across our application. This concept should be familar to you if you have already read the [Pages](./pages.md) or [Layouts](./layouts.md) guides.

Here's a visual example of a `Shared.update` function responding from message you might find in a real world application:

```elm{8-23}
module Shared exposing (..)

-- ...

update : Route () -> Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Effect Msg )
update route msg model =
    case msg of
        SignInApiResponded user ->
            ( { model | user = Just user }
            , Effect.none
            )
        
        SignOutClicked ->
            ( { model | user = Nothing }
            , Effect.none
            )

        WindowResized width height ->
            ( { model
                  | window = { width = width, height = height }
              }
            , Effect.none
            )

-- ...
```

## `Shared.subscriptions`

Just like on a page or a layout, the `Shared` module allows you to continually listen for events and fire a `Msg` when they occur.

If your application needs to know the current window size, you might use this function with `Browser.Events.onResize` to keep track of the current size of the window:

```elm
module Shared exposing (..)

-- ..

subscriptions : Route () -> Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions route model =
    Browser.Events.onResize WindowResized
```

The subscriptions defined here will be active regardless of the page you are on. This means you can reliably use `shared.window.width` in any of your pages, and won't have to worry about it getting out-of-sync!


## `Shared.onUrlRequest`

If your application needs to perform some special logic before the URL changes, like saving some application state in local storage before the browser navigates to an external URL, you can use this function to specify the shared `Msg` to run through `Shared.update` to handle the incoming `Browser.UrlRequest`.

The default handles it by calling `Browser.Navigation.load` on `External` URLs and calling `Browser.Navigation.pushUrl` on `Internal` URLs, like this:

```elm
module Shared exposing (..)

-- ...

update : Route () -> Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Effect Msg )
update route msg model =
    case msg of
        Shared.Msg.UrlRequested (Browser.Internal url) ->
            ( model
            , let
                { path, query, hash } =
                    (Route.fromUrl () url)
              in
              Effect.pushRoute
                { path = path
                , query = query
                , hash = hash
                }
            )

        Shared.Msg.UrlRequested (Browser.External url) ->
            if String.isEmpty (String.trim url) then
                ( model, Effect.none )

            else
                ( model
                , Effect.loadExternalUrl url
                )

-- ...
```

Note that this runs before either `Page.withOnUrlChanged` or `Layout.withOnUrlChanged` and can potentially prevent them from running depending on how you handle the `UrlRequest`, since they only run if you actually perform a URL change with something like `Browser.Navigation.pushUrl`.
