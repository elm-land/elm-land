## Introduction

Welcome to [Elm Land](https://elm.land), an application framework that helps you build reliable web applications using the [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) programming language. 

Inspired by projects like [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), Elm Land's goal is make you feel productive _fast_â€“ even if you're completely new to Elm.

We take care of the developer tooling, conventions, and provide learning resources so you can focus on building your next app with confidence.
